This document defines the **V1 architecture, UX flows, and operational expectations** for the IRL Streamer Stack. It is intended to be a stable reference before implementation begins.

## 0.0 - What This Stack Is (For New IRL Streamers)

**Syronius’ Frame (F.R.A.M.E.)** stands for:

> **F**ederated **R**elay & **A**utomation for **M**edia & **E**xperiences

It is a **self-hosted control center for IRL streaming and live photography**, designed to orchestrate everything *around* your stream — not just the video feed.

If you are:

- transitioning from studio streaming to IRL,
- a photographer who wants tighter control over how images appear on stream,
- or someone who wants to reduce manual glue between OBS, StreamerBot, cameras, and overlays,

F.R.A.M.E. exists to make live production **predictable, observable, and intentional**.

At a high level, the stack helps you:

- **Relay live media reliably** (video, audio, photos)
- **Automate decisions and timing** instead of reacting live
- **Federate tools** like OBS, StreamerBot, cameras, and browsers into one system
- **Present media intentionally** on stream and remotely

All of this is done **locally and under your control**, with optional remote access for web pages only.

---

### A) Why These Problems Matter in IRL Streaming

IRL streaming is uniquely difficult because:

- your network conditions change constantly
- you are often multitasking (walking, shooting, talking, navigating)
- you cannot afford fragile or manual workflows
- small failures compound quickly on stream

This stack exists to **reduce cognitive load while live** by making:

- ingest reliable
- automation predictable
- visual presentation intentional

Instead of fighting tools mid‑stream, you configure behavior *before* you go live.

---

### B) Goals

#### Primary Goals

- Self‑hosted **SRTLA ingest** with management UI
- Robust **photo ingest pipeline** with JPG‑only normalization
- Deterministic **StreamerBot handoff** using `.ready` manifests
- **OBS overlays** with a wizard and live preview
- **Hybrid mode** (Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTP only)
- **Remote Audio Monitor** (Windows source, AAC, always‑on)


---

## 1.0 - High‑Level UX

### A) Installation & Reconfiguration UX

The stack ships with a single installer entrypoint (`stack.sh` for Linux/macOS and `stack.cmd` for Windows) that supports subcommands. 

Supported commands (V1):

- **install**

  - Installs or reconfigures the environment.
  - Prompts the user to build/update `.env` and `/data` structures.
  - Generates/updates `docker-compose.yml` and `stack-config.json`.
  - Validates prerequisites (Docker + Compose).
  - Validates **port conflicts** and halts on conflicts.
  - Deploys the stack (`docker compose up -d`) with selected profiles.
  - Re-running `install` allows enabling/disabling features and switching **LAN vs Hybrid**.
  - Shows a full breakdown of previous setup (or fresh install details).
  - Option: set services to be **always-on** (container restart policy `restart: always`).

- **start**

  - Brings up the container stack (`docker compose up -d`).
  - If config is missing, prompts the user to run `install`.

- **stop**

  - Stops the container stack (`docker compose down`).
  - If config is missing, prompts the user to run `install`.

- **status**

  - Prints installation status and service/container state.
  - Reports container uptime when available.
  - Lists enabled capabilities from `stack-config.json`.
  - Prints current `.env` values with sensitive fields **redacted**.

- **reset**

  - Destructive reinstall.
  - Stops and removes containers (and associated volumes where applicable).
  - Deletes `./data` directory.
  - Re-runs the interactive `install` flow to recreate `.env` and `./data`.
  - Requires explicit confirmation.

*Updates are out of scope for V1.*

### B) Configuration Persistence

- Feature choices persist across runs
- Data is never deleted when disabling features
- Only the `reset` path removes data

### C) Modes

- **LAN-Only** – everything local
- **Hybrid** – HTTP via Cloudflare Tunnel, ingest + FTP stay LAN (requires cloudflared token)

### D) Portal (Unified Navigation Shell)

A dedicated **Portal service** provides a shared navigation and landing experience.

- Nav is **not hardcoded**
- Nav is generated dynamically from `stack-config.json`
- Each item reflects:
  - Enabled / Disabled
  - Ready / Needs setup / Offline

The portal links to (never iframes) other UIs.

### E) Dashboard

Single landing page linking to:

- Stream Management (SLS UI)
- Overlay Wizard + generated OBS URLs
- Today Gallery / Viewer / Remote Controller
- Manual Upload
- Audio Monitor Admin + Listen links
- System Status

---

## 2.0 - Core Modules

This section defines the **modules** of Syronius’ Frame and how they map to **containers** in the V1 docker-compose stack.

### A) Container Map (V1)

> Container names are themed and consistent to keep `docker ps`, logs, and documentation readable.

---

### B) Reverse Proxy

- Traefik (internal routing)
- Optional Cloudflared (Hybrid mode)

### C) SRTLA + SLS

- OpenIRL `srtla-receiver`
- OpenIRL `sls-management-ui`
- **Dependency:** SLS UI requires SRTLA receiver
- SLS Stream IDs become **Stream Profiles** usable by overlays

### D) Overlay Server

- Existing Express app
- Two overlays (telemetry + upload progress)
- Extended with:
  - Overlay Wizard
  - Live preview iframe
  - Presets
  - Placement controls (`dock`, `pad`, `scale`)

#### Telemetry Stats Source (V1)

Default stats URL pattern (from `frame-ingest-video`):

- `http://<host-ip>:8080/stats/<play-id>`

Notes:

- `<play-id>` is derived from the SLS Stream Profile.
- The overlay server should treat stats as best-effort: show a clear "NO SIGNAL" or "OFFLINE" state when unreachable.

**Dependencies (V1 default UX):**

- Bitrate overlay requires **SRTLA receiver** (stats source)
- Overlay Wizard requires **SLS UI / Stream Profiles** (stream selection without manual URLs)
- Upload progress overlay requires **Photo Pipeline** (or upload telemetry source)

### E) Photo Ingest (Inputs)

These do **not** add images to galleries directly. They only accept uploads and pass them to the Photo Pipeline.

- **FTP Server (Input):** uploads land in `/data/inbox`
- **Manual Upload Service (Input):** browser/phone uploads

#### Completed Upload Contract (V1)

Only **completed** files may enter `/data/staging`.

**Preferred (when supported by the client/server):**

- Upload into `/data/inbox/<name>.<ext>.uploading`
- On completion, atomically rename to `/data/inbox/<name>.<ext>`
- Then atomically move/rename into:
  - `/data/staging/<name>.<ext>`

**Fallback (camera/client limitations): size-stability gate**

Because some camera FTP clients may not support temp extensions or atomic rename semantics, the input layer must support a stability-based completion check:

- A file in `/data/inbox` is considered complete when its **size has not changed for 3 seconds**.
- Only then is it moved to `/data/staging`.

Notes:

- The move from inbox → staging should be an atomic rename on the same filesystem when possible.
- The pipeline must ignore `/data/inbox` entirely; it only processes `/data/staging`.

**Dependency:** FTP and Manual Upload are only useful when **Photo Pipeline** is enabled.

### F) Photo Pipeline (Required for all images)

The Photo Pipeline is the **single source of truth** for:

- when an image is considered **complete**
- what files are considered **publishable**
- how metadata is extracted and represented for overlays and StreamerBot

It processes files that arrive in:

- `/data/staging` (complete uploads only)

> Partial/temporary uploads must remain in `/data/inbox`. The **FTP input** and **Manual Upload** services are responsible for moving completed files to `/data/staging` (ideally via atomic rename).

#### V1 State Machine

`INBOX (partial) → STAGING (complete) → NORMALIZE/EXTRACT → PUBLISH → (optional) DISCORD → ARCHIVE | QUARANTINE`

#### V1 Publish Rules

- Only images that can be converted to **JPG** are publishable in V1.
- RAW formats are **not** processed in V1 (quarantine instead). RAW support is a V2 goal.
- If EXIF is missing, sidecars are still created with placeholders.

#### Output Location

Published outputs go to the current day folder:

- `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/`

`/data/today` is a convenience link to the current day folder.

**Multi-day runtime rule (V1):**

- If the stack runs across multiple days, the pipeline must keep `/data/today` up to date.
- After computing `YYYY-MM-DD` (using `.env TIMEZONE`), the pipeline:
  - ensures `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/` exists
  - updates `/data/today` → `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/` using an **atomic symlink swap** (temp link + rename)
- UI routes should treat `DATA_ROOT/state/latest.json.date_folder` as the canonical selector for the active day folder (symlink is a convenience).

#### Base Naming

`<base>` is derived from the original filename so operators can search by camera/phone file name.

V1 format:

- `<original>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH_mm_ss`

Where:

- `<original>` is the original filename **without extension**, sanitized for filesystem safety
- `YYYY-MM-DD_HH_mm_ss` is the **processing completion timestamp** (derived using `.env TIMEZONE`)

Example:

- `DSC_0421_2025-12-29_21_14_07`

Collision handling (V1):

- If `<base>` already exists in the target day folder, append a short suffix: `_2`, `_3`, etc.

#### Processing Steps (V1)

When a new file appears in `/data/staging`:

1. **Identify file type**

   - If file is not an image → **QUARANTINE** with `<base>.error`

2. **Determine target day folder**

   - Use the **current local date** at the time processing completes → `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - The local date is derived from the `.env` \`\`\*\* (TZ)\*\* setting to ensure consistent behavior across hosts and containers.
   - Rationale: ensures all images uploaded during a stream session land in **"today"** regardless of when they were taken.
   - Create `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/` if missing

3. **EXIF extraction** (best-effort)

   - Export full metadata to:
     - `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.json`
   - If no EXIF:
     - still write `<base>.json` with placeholders (e.g., `{ "exif": "unknown" }`)

4. **Normalize to JPG**

   - If already JPG/JPEG, validate it can be decoded.
   - If convertible (HEIC/PNG/etc.), convert to JPG.
   - Write the image to:
     - `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.jpg`
   - On conversion failure:
     - retry up to **3 attempts**
     - then **QUARANTINE** with `<base>.error`

5. **Create StreamerBot sidecars**

   - Formatted camera settings text:
     - `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.txt`
     - If unknown, write `(unknown)` placeholders.
   - Orientation flag:
     - `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.orientation`
     - `0` = landscape, `1` = portrait
     - Determined from final JPG dimensions (portrait if height > width).

6. **Create ****\`\`**** manifest (must be last)**

   Location:

   - `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.ready` (also visible under `/data/today/`)

   Contents (line-based):

   - Line 0: full host path to JPG
     - `DATA_ROOT/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.jpg`
   - Line 1: full host path to TXT (used directly as an OBS text source)
     - `DATA_ROOT/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD/<base>.txt`
   - Line 2: orientation flag (`0` or `1`)

   **Atomic write rule:** `.ready` is written to a temp name then renamed into place.

7. \*\*Update \*\*\`\`

   - Update `DATA_ROOT/state/latest.json` only after `.ready` is present.
   - Write should be atomic (temp + rename).

8. **Cleanup**

   - Move or delete the staged source file after successful publish.
   - Optionally move the original into `/data/archive/` for retention.

#### Quarantine Contract

On rejection, move the original into:

- `/data/quarantine/`

And write an error descriptor:

- `/data/quarantine/<base>.error.json`

##### `error.json` schema (V1)

```json
{
  "reason_code": "PPL-01",
  "reason": "NOT_IMAGE",
  "detail": "Detected file type did not match an image container; conversion was not attempted.",
  "original_name": "IMG_1234.MOV",
  "detected_mime": "video/quicktime",
  "attempts": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-29T21:14:07-06:00",
  "log_ref": "frame-pipeline-photos:2025-12-29T21:14:07-06:00:job-7f3a"
}
```

##### Reason codes (V1)

Codes are stable and machine-readable; `detail` provides human context.

- **PPL-01 — NOT\_IMAGE**
  - File is not an image (or could not be identified as an image)
- **PPL-02 — CONVERT\_FAILED**
  - File failed conversion after max attempts
- **PPL-03 — RAW\_UNSUPPORTED**
  - File appears to be a RAW format (V1 does not process RAW)
- **PPL-04 — DECODE\_FAILED**
  - File claims to be JPG/PNG/etc. but cannot be decoded (corrupt/truncated)
- **PPL-05 — EXIF\_EXTRACT\_FAILED**
  - EXIF extraction step failed (publish may still proceed with placeholders unless other failures occur)
- **PPL-06 — FILE\_ACCESS\_ERROR**
  - Permission/locking/read error while processing
- **PPL-07 — PIPELINE\_INTERNAL\_ERROR**
  - Unexpected exception; catch-all

##### Notes

- `detected_mime` is the best-effort detected media type (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/heic`, `application/octet-stream`). It helps answer "what did we think this was?".
- `log_ref` is a lightweight log pointer (container name + timestamp + job id). Full stack traces are optional and may live only in logs.

Rejected files do **not** update `latest.json`.

#### Parallelism & Throughput (V1)

- Pipeline processes multiple files concurrently using a bounded worker pool.
- Default concurrency should be conservative (e.g., 2–4 workers) to avoid I/O thrash.
- Per-file output generation must remain ordered such that `.ready` is always last.

#### Discord Webhook Sink (Optional)

If Discord is enabled:

- After `.ready` is written:
  1. Create a Discord-safe copy in:
     - `/data/discord/<base>_discord.jpg`
     - Ensure image is compressed to be under **10 MB**
  2. Send via webhook with the formatted camera settings from `<base>.txt`

Rate-limiting rules (V1):

- Use a separate bounded queue for Discord sends.
- Respect webhook rate limits by throttling and retrying on 429.
- Do not block photo publishing on Discord failures; failures should be logged and retried.
- \*\*After a successful Discord webhook post, delete the corresponding file from \*\*\`\` to avoid re-sends and unbounded disk growth.

**Dependencies:**

- Requires at least one input enabled: **FTP Server and/or Manual Upload**

### G) Today Gallery + Viewer

- Gallery for today’s images
- Fullscreen viewer (OBS-friendly)
- Remote controller (phone/tablet)

**Dependency:** requires **Photo Pipeline**

### H) Discord Webhook (Optional)

- Auto-post published images

**Dependency:** requires **Photo Pipeline**

### I) Audio Monitor (V1 – Browser Capture)

**V1 approach:** Audio capture is performed **in-browser** on the LAN host using WebRTC (`getUserMedia`) and a virtual audio cable/VoiceMeeter-provided virtual input device.

#### Output Transport (V1)

- Relay outputs **HLS (AAC)** for listening.
- HLS segments target **1 second** duration to keep monitoring latency low.
- **Bitrate selection (V1):** Admin can set a per-stream target bitrate (preset list, e.g., 64k / 96k / 128k).
  - Implementation note: this is applied by the encoder (ffmpeg) as a fixed bitrate per stream. True “dynamic bitrate” adaptation is a V2 item (would require ABR ladders or congestion-aware transport).

#### Publisher Model (V1)

- **One publisher per stream**. If a publisher is active, additional publishers are rejected.

#### Pages

- `/audio/admin` — Create/manage audio streams (SLS-like) (**LAN-only**)
- `/audio/capture/<streamId>` — Capture/publisher page (**LAN-only**)
- `/audio/listen/<streamId>` — Listener page (tunneled in Hybrid)
- `/audio/hls/<streamId>/...` — HLS playlist/segments (tunneled in Hybrid)

#### Stream ID Management (V1)

- **Rename streamId (V1 recommendation):** treat rename as **create a new stream + delete the old stream**.
  - Rationale: the streamId is embedded in URLs, HLS folder paths, and any saved OBS/browser bookmarks. “True rename” requires migrating state and ensuring old URLs don’t break unexpectedly.
  - UX: provide an **“Duplicate / Rename”** flow that:
    1. creates a new stream with the new id (copying settings like listener limit, bitrate preset, always-on)
    2. shows the new Capture/Listen URLs
    3. offers a final “Delete old stream” button

#### Admin UX (`/audio/admin`)

- “Add audio source” button
- Fields:
  - `streamId` (unique)
  - Listener limit (cap)
  - Always-on mode (silence when offline)
- Actions:
  - Create stream
  - **Delete stream** (removes it from registry and stops its relay)
  - View listen URL
  - View capture URL (LAN)

#### Capture UX (`/audio/capture/<streamId>`)

- Device dropdown (WebRTC device list)
- “Go Live” button
- Real-time health:
  - input metering
  - encoder bitrate/health
  - publish/reconnect status
- **Disconnect listeners** (admin/publisher-side force re-sync)
  - Implementation note: listeners are not truly “kicked” at the transport layer (HLS is pull-based), so this action invalidates the current playlist path by incrementing a `generation` value for the stream (e.g., `/audio/hls/<streamId>/<gen>/index.m3u8`). Listen pages auto-detect and reconnect.
- Optional: “Pop-out mini window” for OBS Window Capture

#### Listen UX (`/audio/listen/<streamId>`)

- Auto-play attempt; provides “Tap to listen” if required by browser policy
- Always-on listening:
  - stream continues with injected silence when capture is offline
- Shows status + listener count

#### Exposure Rules

- **LAN-only:** `/audio/admin/*`, `/audio/capture/*`
- **Hybrid/public:** `/audio/listen/*`, `/audio/hls/*` (through Cloudflare Tunnel)

#### Notes

- No authentication in V1; `streamId` is treated as an unguessable token.

---

### J) Dependency Layering (V1)

Think of the stack as layers with enforced dependencies.

#### Layer 0 — Platform

- Traefik
- (Hybrid) Cloudflared
- Shared `/data` volume

#### Layer 1 — Sources / Inputs

- SRTLA receiver
- FTP input
- Manual upload input

#### Layer 2 — Control Planes

- SLS management UI (requires SRTLA)

#### Layer 3 — Processing

- Photo Pipeline (requires FTP and/or Manual Upload)

#### Layer 4 — Presentation

- Overlays (requires SRTLA; Wizard requires SLS)
- Gallery / Viewer / Remote (requires Photo Pipeline)

#### Layer 5 — Integrations

- Discord webhook uploader (requires Photo Pipeline)
- Audio monitor (independent of SRTLA/photo)

---

## 3.0 - Storage & Contracts

Base path: `/data`

### A) Required Directories

```
/data/inbox
/data/staging
/data/today -> /data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD
/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD
/data/state
/data/logs
/data/quarantine
/data/archive
```

### B) Today Publishing Contract

For each image:

- `<base>.jpg`
- `<base>.json`
- `<base>.txt`
- `<base>.orientation`
- `<base>.ready` (written last)

#### `.ready` Manifest (line‑based)

- Line 0: full path to JPG
- Line 1: full path or contents of TXT
- Line 2: orientation flag

Streamerbot watches: `/data/today/*.ready`

---

## 4.0 - Config & Presets

### A) Static Config (`.env`)

Used for:

- Docker compose profiles
- Secrets and credentials
- Low-level service configuration

`.env` is **generated and updated** by the installer and should not normally be edited by hand.

### B) Capability Config (`/data/state/stack-config.json`)

This file is generated and maintained by the installer and is the **single source of truth** for enabled user-facing features.

It defines **capabilities**, not containers.

Example schema (V1.1 canonical):

```json
{
  "mode": "HYBRID",
  "capabilities": {
    "frame-video-relay": true,
    "frame-audio-relay": true,
    "frame-photo-gallery": true,
    "frame-photo-ftp": true,
    "frame-photo-webupload": true,
    "frame-photo-discord": true,
    "frame-photo-todaytools": true,
    "frame-overlays": true
  },
  "routes": {
    "dashboard": "/dashboard",
    "status": "/status",
    "video_relay_ui": "/slsui",
    "overlays_root": "/overlays",
    "overlays_wizard": "/overlays/setup",
    "photo_gallery": "/gallery",
    "today_gallery": "/today/gallery",
    "today_viewer": "/today/viewer",
    "today_remote": "/today/remote",
    "audio_admin": "/audio/admin",
    "audio_capture": "/audio/capture",
    "audio_listen": "/audio/listen",
    "audio_hls": "/audio/hls"
  },
  "public_route_prefixes": [
    "/dashboard",
    "/status",
    "/overlays",
    "/today",
    "/gallery",
    "/audio/listen",
    "/audio/hls"
  ]
}
```

> The installer owns this file. In HYBRID mode, public exposure is computed from `public_route_prefixes` and capability allowlists; `/audio/admin` and `/audio/capture` are always LAN-only (see Appendix B).


### C) Route Definitions (V1)

- `/today/gallery`

  - Wrapper page with SFPG embedded via `<iframe>`
  - SFPG points at the current day folder: `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Wrapper polls `DATA_ROOT/state/latest.json` every **1 second**
  - If `updated_at` changes, wrapper forces an iframe refresh

- `/today/viewer`

  - Custom fullscreen slideshow viewer (OBS-friendly)
  - Reads images from the current day folder: `/data/galleries/YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Displays EXIF/info as a live text overlay sourced from sidecar files (not burned into image)
  - Supports remote control via `/today/remote`

- `/today/remote`

  - Mobile-friendly controller UI
  - Buttons: previous / next, start slideshow
  - Slider: image duration
  - Optional: **Show thumbnails** toggle (off by default)
  - Shows real-time readout of the currently displayed filename (and optionally a small thumbnail)

#### Viewer Remote Control Protocol (V1)

- Transport: **WebSocket** (preferred for low-latency control)
- The viewer is the source of truth for state.
- `/today/remote` sends commands; `/today/viewer` broadcasts state.

Commands:

- `NEXT`, `PREV`
- `START_SLIDESHOW`, `STOP_SLIDESHOW`
- `SET_INTERVAL_MS`
- `GOTO_INDEX`

Viewer state broadcast (at least on change):

- `current_index`, `current_base`, `current_filename`
- `slideshow_running`, `interval_ms`
- `count_today`

Thumbnail behavior:

- Thumbnails are optional and off by default.
- If enabled, viewer provides a small JPEG/WEBP preview derived from the current image (best-effort).

Controls `/today/viewer` in real time

### D) `latest.json` (V1)

Location: `DATA_ROOT/state/latest.json`

- Updated by the Photo Pipeline after each publish
- Contains at minimum:
  - `updated_at`
  - `date_folder` (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - `latest_image` (optional)
  - `count_today` (optional)



### E) Dependency Enforcement Rules

The installer enforces dependencies automatically:

- Overlays ⇒ require **SRTLA receiver** and **SLS UI**
- Gallery / Viewer / Discord ⇒ require **Photo Pipeline**
- FTP or Manual Upload ⇒ require **Photo Pipeline**
- Disabling a base dependency disables dependent capabilities

Users are warned of cascading changes before config is saved.

### F) Presets

- Overlay presets are stored in `/data/state/overlay-presets.json` or sqlite
- Presets generate stable URLs usable directly in OBS

---

## 5.0 - Network Exposure

### A) Design Principle

- **Traefik is the single HTTP edge** for all web UIs.
- In **Hybrid mode**, Cloudflare Tunnel exposes only HTTP/HTTPS routes.
- Non-HTTP services (SRTLA UDP ingest, FTP) remain LAN-only.

### B) Host-Exposed Ports (Documented Defaults)

> These are the default ports the installer must validate for conflicts based on enabled capabilities.

#### Always (when Portal/Web is enabled)

- **80/tcp**  — Traefik HTTP
- **443/tcp** — Traefik HTTPS

> V1 default: Traefik serves **HTTPS on LAN** by default to keep the menu system cohesive and consistent.

#### SRTLA Receiver (when enabled)

- **5000/udp** — SRTLA ingest
- **4001/udp** — SRT ingest
- **4000/udp** — Watch/play
- **8080/tcp** — Stats endpoint (recommended LAN-only; can be internal behind Traefik if desired)

#### SLS Management UI (when enabled)

- Prefer **internal behind Traefik** (no host port).
- If direct exposure is required (not recommended): **3000/tcp**

#### FTP Input (when enabled)

- **21/tcp** — FTP control
- **30000–30100/tcp** — Passive range (configurable)

### C) Exposure by Mode

#### LAN Mode

- Web UIs available on LAN via Traefik (80/443).
- SRTLA UDP ports exposed on LAN.
- FTP exposed on LAN.
- LAN-only pages remain accessible locally:
  - `/audio/admin/*`, `/audio/capture/*`

#### Hybrid Mode

- Cloudflare Tunnel exposes only Traefik HTTP routes.
- SRTLA UDP ports remain LAN-only (user may optionally port-forward manually).
- FTP remains LAN-only.
- Public/tunneled routes include:
  - `/dashboard`, `/status`
  - `/overlays/*`
  - `/today/*`
  - `/audio/listen/*`, `/audio/hls/*`
- Explicitly excluded from tunnel:
  - `/audio/admin/*`, `/audio/capture/*`

#### Hybrid Exposure Artifact (Generated by Installer)

In Hybrid mode, the installer generates the cloudflared ingress rules from `stack-config.json` capabilities.

- When a capability is enabled, its allowed public routes are added.
- When a capability is disabled (or when switching to LAN mode), the installer rewrites the tunnel config to remove those routes.

Mode switching:

- Switching **Hybrid → LAN** disables/removes the `frame-tunnel` service and deletes/rewrites the generated tunnel config so no HTTP routes remain exposed.
- Switching **LAN → Hybrid** re-enables `frame-tunnel` and regenerates ingress rules.

#### V1.1 Exposure Computation (Deterministic)

In **HYBRID** mode, the installer computes an *effective* public allowlist:

- Start with `public_route_prefixes` from `stack-config.json`
- Normalize and de-duplicate prefixes (e.g., `/today` makes `/today/gallery` redundant)
- Intersect with capability-based allowlists:
  - `/overlays` requires `frame-overlays`
  - `/today` requires `frame-photo-todaytools`
  - `/gallery` requires `frame-photo-gallery`
  - `/audio/listen` and `/audio/hls` require `frame-audio-relay`
- Enforce **LAN-only** exclusions (always forbidden through the tunnel):
  - `/audio/admin`
  - `/audio/capture`

If forbidden prefixes appear in `public_route_prefixes`, the installer MUST strip/ignore them and warn.

(Full rules: **Appendix B**.)


---

## 6.0 - Observability

`/status` endpoint shows:

- Service health
- Last ingest
- Last photo published
- Audio stream status
- Disk usage

---

## 7.0 - Resource Planning

### A) CPU

- Minimum: 4 cores
- Recommended: 6–8 cores

### B) RAM

- Minimum: 8 GB
- Recommended: 16 GB

### C) Disk

- Minimum: 250 GB
- Recommended: 1 TB+

### D) Network

- Audio monitor: \~64–128 kbps per listener

---

### E) Retention & Cleanup Defaults (V1)

Retention is conservative and designed to prevent partial files from lingering, while preserving artifacts useful for troubleshooting.

- `/data/inbox`
  - Delete temp/partial files older than **30 minutes**.
- `/data/staging`
  - Delete files older than **30 minutes** (these should be short-lived).
- `/data/discord`
  - Files are deleted immediately after successful webhook delivery.
  - Files that remain here are considered pending/failed sends and are retained until successfully sent.
- `/data/quarantine`
  - Retained indefinitely by default (manual cleanup by end user).
- `/data/archive`
  - Retained indefinitely by default (this is the primary archive).

> V1 assumes the operator manages disk capacity. If storage becomes low, the stack should surface warnings in `/status` and logs.

---

## 8.0 - Setup Flow

1. Run installer
2. Choose mode and modules
3. Start stack
4. Create SLS stream
5. Configure overlays via wizard
6. Test photo ingest
7. Configure audio streams

---

## 9.0 - Open Decisions

- Stream profile sync method
- Default gallery implementation
- Thumbnail strategy
- Audio transport internals
- Retention defaults

## Appendix B - V1.1 Config Semantics, Validation, and Hybrid Exposure Rules

### Config Semantics, Validation, and Hybrid Exposure Rules

**Purpose:** This document refines V1 by making configuration and mode-switching behavior deterministic for implementation.  
**Non-goals:** This document does not redesign modules or add auth/permissions. V1 remains the architectural source of truth; V1.1 is additive/clarifying.

---

### 1) Canonical capability config: `/data/state/stack-config.json`

#### 1.1 Required top-level fields
- `mode`: `"LAN"` or `"HYBRID"`.
- `capabilities`: a boolean map of user-facing modules (not containers).
- `routes`: a map of route identifiers to absolute paths (leading `/`).
- `public_route_prefixes`: list of absolute path prefixes that are allowed to be exposed publicly **when `mode=HYBRID`**.

#### 1.2 Canonical capabilities (V1 naming for implementation)
```json
{
  "frame-video-relay": true,
  "frame-audio-relay": true,
  "frame-photo-gallery": true,
  "frame-photo-ftp": true,
  "frame-photo-webupload": true,
  "frame-photo-discord": true,
  "frame-photo-todaytools": true,
  "frame-overlays": true
}
```

#### 1.3 Canonical routes (V1.1)
> Route keys are identifiers. **No spaces**. Use `snake_case`.

```json
{
  "dashboard": "/dashboard",
  "status": "/status",

  "video_relay_ui": "/slsui",

  "overlays_root": "/overlays",
  "overlays_wizard": "/overlays/setup",

  "photo_gallery": "/gallery",

  "today_gallery": "/today/gallery",
  "today_viewer": "/today/viewer",
  "today_remote": "/today/remote",

  "audio_admin": "/audio/admin",
  "audio_capture": "/audio/capture",
  "audio_listen": "/audio/listen",
  "audio_hls": "/audio/hls"
}
```

#### 1.4 Canonical public exposure prefixes (Hybrid allowlist)
```json
[
  "/dashboard",
  "/status",
  "/overlays",
  "/today",
  "/gallery",
  "/audio/listen",
  "/audio/hls"
]
```

---

### 2) Normalization rules (installer-owned)

The installer is responsible for maintaining a *normalized* config on disk.

#### 2.1 Path normalization
For every route value and public prefix:
- MUST start with `/`.
- MUST NOT contain `..`.
- SHOULD NOT end with `/` unless the route is literally `/`.

#### 2.2 Prefix set normalization
The installer SHOULD collapse redundant prefixes:
- If `/today` is present, `/today/gallery` is redundant and removed.
- If `/overlays` is present, `/overlays/setup` is redundant and removed.

#### 2.3 Route key aliasing (migration helper)
If older configs include legacy keys (e.g., `sls_ui`), the installer MAY map them to canonical keys on save:
- `sls_ui` → `video_relay_ui`

---

### 3) Dependency enforcement (capability-level)

V1 describes installer-enforced dependencies and cascading disables. V1.1 restates them using the canonical capability names above.

#### 3.1 Dependencies
- `frame-overlays` REQUIRES `frame-video-relay`.
- `frame-photo-gallery` REQUIRES at least one photo input (`frame-photo-ftp` OR `frame-photo-webupload`).
- `frame-photo-todaytools` REQUIRES at least one photo input (`frame-photo-ftp` OR `frame-photo-webupload`).
- `frame-photo-discord` REQUIRES at least one photo input (`frame-photo-ftp` OR `frame-photo-webupload`).
- `frame-video-relay` MAY be enabled without overlays.

#### 3.2 Cascading disables
If a base dependency is turned off, dependent capabilities MUST be turned off automatically.
The installer MUST warn the operator about cascading changes before saving.

#### 3.3 Data safety
Disabling capabilities MUST NOT delete user data. Only an explicit `reset` path removes `/data`.

---

### 4) Hybrid exposure computation

#### 4.1 Design principle
- Traefik is the single HTTP edge for all UIs.
- In HYBRID, Cloudflare Tunnel exposes **only** selected HTTP route prefixes.
- Non-HTTP services (SRTLA UDP ingest, FTP) remain LAN-only.

#### 4.2 Allowed public prefixes by rule
When `mode=HYBRID`, the **effective** public exposure is:

`effective_public_prefixes = normalize(public_route_prefixes) ∩ allowed_prefixes_by_capabilities`

Where `allowed_prefixes_by_capabilities` includes:

- Always allowed (when Portal exists):
  - `/dashboard`, `/status`
- If `frame-overlays`:
  - `/overlays`
- If `frame-photo-gallery`:
  - `/gallery`
- If `frame-photo-todaytools`:
  - `/today`
- If `frame-audio-relay`:
  - `/audio/listen`, `/audio/hls`

#### 4.3 Explicitly forbidden in Hybrid
Even if present in config, the installer MUST NOT expose these via tunnel:
- `/audio/admin`
- `/audio/capture`

The installer MUST strip or ignore forbidden prefixes in HYBRID and emit a warning.

---

### 5) Mode switching rules

#### 5.1 LAN mode
- All web UIs reachable on LAN through Traefik.
- LAN-only pages remain available locally (`/audio/admin/*`, `/audio/capture/*`).

#### 5.2 HYBRID mode
- `frame-tunnel` is enabled.
- The installer generates cloudflared ingress rules from `stack-config.json` (using the exposure computation above).
- Only `effective_public_prefixes` are tunneled.

#### 5.3 Switching HYBRID → LAN
When `mode` changes from HYBRID to LAN, the installer MUST:
1. Disable/remove `frame-tunnel` from the compose deployment.
2. Delete or rewrite the generated tunnel config so **no** HTTP routes remain exposed publicly.
3. Leave `/data` intact.

#### 5.4 Switching LAN → HYBRID
When `mode` changes from LAN to HYBRID, the installer MUST:
1. Validate tunnel prerequisites (e.g., token present).
2. Enable `frame-tunnel`.
3. Regenerate ingress rules using the current config and capabilities.

---

### 6) Validation and failure behavior

#### 6.1 Config validation
The installer and Portal MUST validate `stack-config.json` at startup.
If invalid:
- Portal SHOULD show a clear error page with what failed and how to re-run installer.
- Installer MUST refuse to apply invalid config.

#### 6.2 Common validation checks
- `mode` is one of `LAN|HYBRID`.
- All canonical capability keys exist and are booleans.
- All canonical route keys exist and route values start with `/`.
- `public_route_prefixes` is a unique list of `/...` strings.
- In HYBRID:
  - forbidden prefixes (`/audio/admin`, `/audio/capture`) are removed/ignored with warning.
  - `effective_public_prefixes` must not be empty unless operator explicitly confirms (optional).

---

### 7) Scenarios (how this behaves)

#### Scenario A — Fresh HYBRID install
- `mode=HYBRID`, all capabilities true, `public_route_prefixes` set to defaults.
- Public access works for `/today/*`, `/overlays/*`, `/gallery/*`, `/audio/listen/*`, `/audio/hls/*`.
- `/audio/admin/*` and `/audio/capture/*` remain LAN-only.

#### Scenario B — HYBRID → LAN “pull the plug”
- Operator sets `mode=LAN`.
- Installer removes/disables `frame-tunnel` and clears tunnel ingress.
- All services continue to work on LAN via Traefik; no public exposure remains.

#### Scenario C — Disable overlays while staying HYBRID
- Operator sets `frame-overlays=false`.
- Installer removes `/overlays` from the effective tunnel allowlist and updates nav status.
- Today + gallery + audio listen can remain public if still enabled.

#### Scenario D — Misconfigured public prefixes include LAN-only routes
- Config mistakenly includes `/audio/admin` in `public_route_prefixes`.
- Installer strips it in HYBRID, warns, and proceeds without exposing it.

#### Scenario E — Route drift
- Operator changes `routes.video_relay_ui` path but forgets to update public prefixes.
- Local nav still works (routes drive nav), but public exposure might not include the new path.
- Recommendation: treat `public_route_prefixes` as installer-managed/derived, not hand-edited.
